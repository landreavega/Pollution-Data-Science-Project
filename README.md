# Introduction:

With the amount of cars on the road, factories producing large quantities of goods, and a myriad of other things that we as humans do to contribute to air pollution it is imperative to ask what effects might the polluted air have on us? In this project we have narrowed our focus toward Asthma as it is one of the most common respiratory diseases. Through data analysis and application of data science practices we will investigate the possibility of a causal link between asthma and air pollution.
