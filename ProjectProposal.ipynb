    "Los Angeles is ranked amongst the worst in the country in regard to air pollution(1). About 43.3% of the American population lives in counties with unhealthy ozone and/or particle pollution levels,and one of our team members is part of this population, which is why this topic is important to us(1). The rest of our team members also live in close proximity to Los Angeles, which adds more importance to the topic. Since we all regularly use our cars it makes us a contributor to the externalized cost of air pollution, and looking into this topic will reconsider lifestyle decisions.\n",
    "There has also been an increase in respiratory diseases in California over the past years, leading to many death cases(2). This is also an important part of our topic since one of our group members has recently experience lung issues with short breath problems. \n",
